# libnet

## Description 
LibNet is a service that unifies the search of the books for a user, making it more simple. Libraries can plug into our system to keep track of available books and let users reserve them easily. The aggregator is built to work with many libraries at once, so everything stays organized and simple to reach. Users, at the same time, can add books to favourites, track availability, and make reservations.
